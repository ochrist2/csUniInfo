            <p>U of T has the most prestigious CS program in Canada, and it mainly has to do with the reputation of the school as a whole coupled
                with the style of teaching. Click on the header to read what U of T has to say about their program. However, to give a run down,
                U of T teaches CS differently than most universities by getting the students to practice programming while in the lecture.
                I find this to be the most effective tool in learning, as practice makes perfect, especially when it comes to the more difficult
                aspects of programming. Along with a different style of teaching, U of T has more teaching professors in the CS department
                than any other university in Ontario. </p></div>

        <div class="col-md-6" style="font-size: 16px"><h1>Why York (The School)?</h1><p>The University of Toronto is the highest rated university in Ontario, and is regularly the top university in Canada.
            Being the 32nd best university in the world in 2016 comes from the universities extensive research,
            academic reputation, and reputation with employers. The main reasons why you'd want to go to
            U of T for your undergraduate degree comes from the prestige of the university, which will allow you to
            hopefully join one of the city of Toronto's many tech companies ranging from a small start up to tech giants like Apple.
            Between your third and fourth year you have the opportunity to do an industry internship for 8, 12 or 16 months where you will be
            able to gain work experience before you graduate, and given that the school is in Toronto, going to U of T gives you an exceptional leg up on getting a job in the city.
            Another great thing about U of T is its large number of teaching professors.
            Although U of T's reputation, and
            incredible academics are great reasons to attend the school, the work load is very difficult, and the "student experience" is rated rather low.
            Due to the difficulty, and lower focus on the student life at U of T, many students find themselves overwhelmed with work, and rather lonely due to the lack of a
            definite community. This is not to say that if you go to U of T you'll have a bad experience, but it is important to keep in mind that many people
            have brought these complaints to light, and there is some truth behind them. Overall Toronto is the best school in Ontario and the entirety of Canada.
            If you're looking for the best education in computer science, pursue the University of Toronto.</p></div>

        <div class="col-md-6"><h1>How do I get in?</h1>U of T do not have the exact average for admissions posted on their site, however <a href="http://www.electronicinfo.ca/programs/203">Electronicinfo.ca</a> says that
            the grade range for acceptance is from the low 90's. From personal experience, I find this to be true. If you have above a 90% average from a well regarded
            highschool (universities keep track of the highschools which have inflated grades), you have a decent chance of admission, but the only the way to be sure of acceptance is to have around a 93-95% average.
            Your most important classes when applying to CS at U of T are Calculus and English. Since these are the only required courses for the program, they will be regarded more than other classes.

            <h1>Department:</h1>
            <p>CS at U of T is under the department of Arts and Science. This does not mean much considering most programs at U of T lie
